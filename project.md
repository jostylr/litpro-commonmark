# [litpro-commonmark](# "version: 0.2.1 ; markdown rendering to html in litpro using commonmark")

This implements the md command using commonmark. 

If litpro is installed, run `litpro -b . project.md` initially. After that, one can
just run `litpro` and the lprc.js file will do what needs to be
done. 

This is designed to work with the 1.0 version of literate-programming.

## Index

This is the module entry point. It adds the command md.

The setup is that in `Folder/folder/doc.plugins.commonmark`, we have the
actors that can have the keys init, pre, during, post, exit. The init should
initialize things (such as the reader and writer), the pre deals with the text
before the main parsing, during initiates the parsing and is then available,
and post starts with the rendering to html and then allows further
modifications. Exit is a cleanup or log routine if needed. 

Each argument calls in an actor. One can define an actor inline using `
{...}` and the object should have at least one of the keys above to be usef. The
arguments will be acted in the order given; the standard one comes first. 

In the future: after the actor name one can have arguments. 

`tex($..$, $$..$$, \[..\], \(..\) ) , log `


The only predefined actor other than standard is the tex actor which will
escape out tex delimited stuff (dollar signs, etc). And log. 


    var commonmark = require('commonmark');
    var noop = function () {};

    var actors = {
        _commonmark : commonmark,
        standard : _"standard", 
        tex : _"tex"
    };
       

    module.exports = function (Folder) {

        Folder.sync("md", function (text, args) {
            var doc = this;
            var data = {text: text};
            var crew = {};

            var actors = Object.create(doc.plugins.commonmark);
            
            _":see if args is an object"
            
            if (args.indexOf("standard") === -1 ) {
                args.unshift("standard");
            }


            _":args | sub PLACE, init" 
            _":args | sub PLACE, pre" 
            _":args | sub PLACE, during" 
            _":args | sub PLACE, post" 
            _":args | sub PLACE, exit" 

            return data.html;
        });

        Folder.plugins.commonmark = actors;


    };

[see if args is an object]()

If the argument is `{ ...}`, then the object gets added to the processor in
which case it gets labelled as `_#` where the number is the position of the
argument number.



    args.forEach( function (el, i) {
        var key, val;
        el = el.trim();
        if (el[0] === "{") {
            key = "\u005F"+i;
            try {
                val = JSON.parse(el);
            } catch (e) {
                console.error("Error in args", e, el);
                val = {};
            }
            args[i] = key;
            actors[key] = val;

        }
    });





[args]()

This runs over the arguments and tries to use any that modify any part of the
process. 

    args.forEach( function (el) {
        (actors[el].PLACE || noop)(data, crew, actors );
    });

### Standard

This does the main processing. 

    {
        init: function (data, crew) {
            crew.reader = new commonmark.Parser();
            crew.writer = new commonmark.HtmlRenderer();
        },
        during : function (data, crew) {
            data.parsed = crew.reader.parse(data.text); // parsed is a 'Node' tree 
        },
        post : function (data, crew) { 
            data.html = crew.writer.render(data.parsed); 
        }
    }


### Litpro

To have substitutions that can occur after the markdown processing, be sure to
use `\1_"whatever"` Using commonmark, this works out fine. 



### Tex

Here we want to escape tex sequences so that the stuff does not get seen by
the marked processor. In particular, any sequence that has double dollar
signs, single dollar signs, backslash paren and backslash square bracket as
delimiters. Note that if these are in backticks, they still get escaped. Which
should be fine (we replace it as is).


    {
        init : _":init",
        pre:  _":pre",
        post : _":post"
    }

[init]()

    function (data, crew) {
        data.tex = [];
        crew.texsnip = function (match) {
            var tex = data.tex;
            tex.push(match);
            return "TEXSNIP"+(tex.length-1);
        };
        crew.texunsnip = function (match, number) {
            return data.tex[parseInt(number, 10)];
        };
        crew.texreg = /\$\$[^$]+\$\$|\$[^$\n]+\$|\\\(((?:[^\\]|\\(?!\)))+)\\\)|\\\[((?:[^\\]|\\(?!\]))+)\\\]/g;

    }

[pre]() 

    function (data, crew) {
        data.text = data.text.replace(crew.texreg, crew.texsnip);
    }


[post]()

    function (data, crew) {
        data.html = data.html.replace(/TEXSNIP(\d+)/g, crew.texunsnip);
    }

### Log

A quick log of the text. Can be used at any point to see the state of the
text. 


## lprc

This creates the lprc file for the plugin. Basically, it just says to run
project.md as the file of choice and to build it in the top directory.


    module.exports = function(Folder, args) {
    
        require('litpro-jshint')(Folder);

        if (args.file.length === 0) {
            args.file = ["project.md"];
        }
        args.build = ".";
        args.src = ".";


    };

## Test 

    /*global require */

    var tests = require('literate-programming-cli-test')("node ../../node_modules/literate-programming-cli/litpro.js");

    tests( 
        ["simple", "-b ."],
        ["tex", "-b ."],
        ["lp", "-b ."],
        ["sample", "-b ."]
    );

## Readme

This is the readme for the plugin.  

    # Commonmark

    This is a plugin for [literate-programming](https://github.com/jostylr/literate-programming). 
    
    Install `npm install litpro-commonmark` and then you can use this by requiring it in the lprc.js file.


    ## Example lprc.js

    module.exports = function (Folder) {
        require("litpro-commonmark")(Folder);
    }

    ## Example project.md

    This is a file you could run to generate some html using this. 

        _":sample"


[sample]() 

[tests/sample/project.md](# "save:") 

    # Sample MD

    We just want to create a simple document. 

        <html>
            <body>
                \_"content | md"
            </body>

    [simple.html](# "save:")

    ## Content

        I **love** markdown. Can't you tell?

        There are lots of plugins to use:

        * commonmark
        * marked
        * showdown
        * ...

        I went with commonmark because it has a spec!



## npm package

## gitignore

Stuff not to include in git. Don't check in your modules.

    node_modules
    .checksum

    

## npmignore

npm does not need to see your tests or your litpro code. Submit the js stuff!
Despite the `*.md`, your readme file will be seen. 

    tests
    test.js
    travis.yml
    ghpages
    node_modules
    *.md
    

## Travis

You write tests, right? 


    language: node_js
    node_js:
      - "0.10"
      - "iojs"
      - "0.12"
