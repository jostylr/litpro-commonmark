# Sample MD

We just want to create a simple document. 

    <html>
        <body>
            _"content | md"
        </body>

[simple.html](# "save:")

## Content

    I **love** markdown. Can't you tell?

    There are lots of plugins to use:

    * commonmark
    * marked
    * showdown
    * ...

    I went with commonmark because it has a spec!
